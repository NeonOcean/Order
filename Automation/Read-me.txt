Running Build.py will build the mod.
This setup will only rebuild Python files, some types of files may not be rebuilt as the tools for doing so would not be included with this Automation setup.
When merging mod files the setup will use already existing files instead.

In order to build all file types you need go through the automation setup located elsewhere.
